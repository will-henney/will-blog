:END:

I have decided to start writing a technical blog, hosted on github pages.  It will be focused on python, emacs, and astrophysics.

This all started in a roundabout way after I was looking into bi-directional import/export between Things 3 and Emacs org-mode.  That led me to looking at Karl Voit's [[https://github.com/novoid/orgformat][orgformat]] python library, which in turn led to his [[https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg][lazyblorg]] blogging environment for org-mode.  I had always meant to try and start a blog, making use of all the reams of material that I write in my org-mode notes, but had never got round to it.  This has finally pushed me into making the leap. 

However, I quickly realised that lazyblorg was not necessarily the best approach: there are [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-blog-wiki.html][many other]] options for blogging from emacs org-mode.  It looks like ox-hugo is the most feature-filled and widely used, and maybe I will even get to learn the Go language.  I guess I am not quite lazy enough for lazyblorg.

** TODO New mechanical keyboard

*HELLO, THIS IS TYPING  WITH MY NEW.  ANNE PRO KEYBOARD*

How much noise=
This is my new keyboard

i am the best

edith is the best 

Keyboard is now set up just how I want.  Control, Alt, Command from inside to out. 
This makes using Emacs much more pleasant.  For the right side, I moved the Alt key to be in next to Ctrl, with the FN1 and FN2 keys moved to the outside. 

To configure the keys on the keyboard, rather than the OS, you have to connect via USB to a Mac or PC. Doing this has the advantage that you only need to do it once, and you will have the same bindings whatever device you pair with.  

Then, you can use the key removal tool to swap the physical keys to conform to the layout that you have configured. 
The physical Cmd key was labeled Win, so I have replaced it with a bright magenta key.  
This looks great, since it is the lower-left corner. 
For balance, I swapped the physical FN2 key with a bright green key, which is in the lower-right corner.

One thing to remember is that backtick and tilde require using the FN key. In fact, tilde does not work with right shift for some reason.  Only with left shift, which is more awkward. ~AAA~

The tap keys for the arrows work great. But if I want to press and hold, I can use FN plus W,A,S,D.

So, that is a picture. Does it still work?
